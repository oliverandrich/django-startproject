> Django startproject template with batteries and nice tooling.

I took the inspiration from Jeff Triplett's [django-startproject](https://github.com/jefftriplett/django-startproject) and created my own starter for a fresh django project. It includes the batteries I use regularly. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The template is also inspired by Carlton Gibson's Post [The Single Folder Django Project Layout](https://noumenal.es/notes/django/single-folder-layout/). It uses the single folder layout as a start as I always run in the same situation Carlton describes in his post. If you have to split the project into several apps, you can always call `python manage.py startapp` later on.

Out of the box SQLite is configured, but you can easily activate MySQL or Postgres support.
